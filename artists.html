	<p class="bio">Samuel Adam Swope, born 1984 in Missouri, USA, currently based in Hong Kong, is an artist most recognized for his Aerial Art and for inventing novel situations with artistic merit. Samuel feeds off his innate boyish curiosities, imagination, and mischievous behavior. Merging multiple media and engineering practices, Swope constructs and controls aesthetic systems that work with air and are often themselves airborne. Throughout his research and studio practice he concerns the behavioral dimensions of control processes, and he often engages with issues on hybridity, atmosphere, autonomy, agency, and the non-human.His continued interest in contemporary uses of apparatuses, performance, technology and DIY culture has enabled him to exhibit and lecture internationally in art spaces and academic and cultural institutions, for example ISEA 2016 Hong Kong, Este: Coordenadas Itinerantes Colombia, Nightingale Chicago, and FILE 2015 Brazil.Samuel received a BFA in sculpture from Missouri State University in 2007. In 2014 he earned his MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago within the Art and Technology department as their full merit scholar. In 2015 he was a Research Associate at School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong</p>

	<p class="bio">Fito Segrera (b. 1983, COL) is an artist and creative technologist. He holds an MFA degree in Design and Technology from Parsons, The New School in New York. Fito works at the intersection between art, philosophy and technology. Segrera’s philosophical and poetic systems investigate our conventional models of cognition and perception, the limitations of Mind and our relationship with the world and ourselves. His current artistic practice attempts to use the rationality of artificial intelligence to lift the veil of the irrational by exposing the errors behind machine learning and cognitive computing systems. Segrera’s installations and sculptures act as instruments for understanding the limitations of human perception and our ideas about the nature of reality.</p>
