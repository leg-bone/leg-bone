	<p class="bio"> I find the aesthetics of this installation to be particularly striking and modern. The contrast of kangi and english letters, the, combination of both noisy textures of the hyper-physical objects and the clean, black background, the bright neon green with dull maroon colors, and the strange arrangement of boxes combine to form a really unique and memorable piece. The text, "This is not a hyper-object, this is a sink and a mirror" is quite humorus to me as well, idk why.

	<p class="bio"> Samuel’s installation is a commentary on the evolution of drone-like technology. I think the inherent humor of the quadcopters being the product, and they’re “delivering” themselves to be really potent for the subject matter.The fact that viewers can access the code of the quadcopters to get a deeper experience with installation is very cool as well.

I find the aesthetics of Frito’s installation poster to be particularly striking and modern.the combination of both noisy textures of the hyper-physical objects and the clean, black background, the bright neon green with dull maroon colors, and the strange arrangement of boxes combine to form a really unique and memorable piece. The text, "This is not a hyper-object, this is a sink and a mirror" is quite humorous to me as well, idk why.</p>
