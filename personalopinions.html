	<p class="bio"> I find the aesthetics of this installation to be particularly striking and modern. The contrast of kangi and english letters, the, combination of both noisy textures of the hyper-physical objects and the clean, black background, the bright neon green with dull maroon colors, and the strange arrangement of boxes combine to form a really unique and memorable piece. The text, "This is not a hyper-object, this is a sink and a mirror" is quite humorus to me as well, idk why.

	<p class="bio"> I think the concept of this installation is brilliant. An interest or fascination is almost surely instilled in all of us WebDev students, and just about anybody who intentionally leans into technology more so than is already mandated by the way the world is currently functioning. Personally, I've acknowledged this fascination of "cool computer stuff," and even embraced it, all without questioning what exactly was so intriguing to me about it all. This exhibition by Samuel Adam Swope and Fito Segrera awakes a new mystery in its audience by subjecting their own technological interests or passions to a deep analysis. This artistic feat was certainly accomplished by the installation of somewhat non-functional, technologically "enhanced" household objects, making them fly around on quadcopters equipped with automated sensors. It's an exaggerated mockery of society's longing for the next big tech breakthrough, the flying car, the hoverboard, the future that is so sought after for whatever reason. However, since we could only see the visual advertisement poster for the installation, apparently that image was striking enough to accomplish the same thing as the installation might have if we had attended it IRL. The futurist-inspired art is a little more abstract, and probably couldn't convey too specific of a message on its own, but some of the text in the image alludes more directly to the message: "This is not a hyper-object. It's a bathroom with a sink and mirror." This is a direct textual representation of another idea brought up by this installation, which is the idea that no natural entity is any more or less evolved or advanced than another, and all that exists is simply adapted and adjusted to the world around it. These artists argue that the same concept should be applied to technology, and that it's rather odd that we covet new inventions so universally.</p>
